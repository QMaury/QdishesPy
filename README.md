# dishes
A program that keeps the sink empty

This program is based off of a spread-sheet my dad made a while ago, explaining what we should do if there are dishes in the sink. it was pretty gay.
I decided to adapt the spreadsheet into a digital computer program as practice, and I thought it'd be funny.
it's a little confusing sometimes, but the program's goal is to keep the sink empty.

Upon running the program, you will notice 3 integers; a series of ones and zeroes. These are booleans whose values are randomly generated at the beginning of each run of the program. the first value means "are there dishes in the sink? True or false" the second means "are there dishes in the machine?" and the third means "are the dishes in the machine clean?". based of off these 3 values, the program decides what steps should be taken in order to keep the sink clean.

I re-wrote this program in C a couple of weeks after making this Python version. The C version is virtually the same as this one, but if you want to check it out, it's at https://github.com/QMaury/QdishesC.
